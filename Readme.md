## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking this project out

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## Where to find everything

Be creative on implementing yours with the images inside the `week3` branch. Figure out a template for mobile view

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/img` folder.
